    <h1>Hello there, I'm Elizabeth!</h1>
    <p>UX/UI Designer, Fullstack Developer</p>
    <div class="head_main">
      <p>Welcome! I've been designing web pages since 2021 when I was interning with the Augustana Web Guild. I fell in
        love with frontend design and quickly discovered the wonderful world of User Experience.</p>
      <p>I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Augustana College in the spring of 2023 with a Bachelor's of Art in Computer Science. I've worked on a
        number of projects ranging from entirely backend to producing fullstack desktop and Android apps. I'm happy you're here,
        please feel free to look around!</p>
