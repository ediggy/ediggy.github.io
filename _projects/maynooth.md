overview: "A small furniture company needed an ecommerce website to sell their products through. They needed a desktop and a mobile site design that competed with large furniture brands in style and usability. I was the UX/UI designer for this project. My role included doing case studies on similar websites, UX research with clients and customers, prototyping, creating user profiles, and creating low and high fidelity mockups"

problem: "This furniture company was growing, and needed a website that would help drive sales. The site was created from scratch by doing research into user needs and current furniture ecommerce website standards."

goals: "This website is intended for users to find the perfect pieces for their homes and offices, and to purchase those items from the website.
"

results: "This product was not shipped to production. However, I would have measured the success of the site based on the number of online sales, the number of items in people’s shopping carts that were left unpurchased, and the number of visitors versus the number of purchases. "

### Empathizing with the Users: 
I did research on the demographic of users that primarily shop at furniture stores. With that information I created a couple of user profiles to refer to while designing the product. In this case I came up with two people: A young professional who needed furniture to decorate their new home, and a business professional who needed office furniture to make their office space more welcoming to employees and clients.

### Defining the Problems:
The most important problems for the users would be finding the right styles that matched their current space, their individual needs, and their personalities. Another problem that needed to be solved was to have a simple shopping experience.

### Ideating Solutions:
To solve the users problems, we created a design blog section, as well as a “view this piece in your space” feature, where you could use your phone camera to place an image of the piece in your space, or upload an image of your space to place the furniture in. To make the checkout experience simple, I created a clear navigation as well as added a search function. The products have a clear “add to cart” button, as well as reviews from other people, so the users can get a better feel for how the product will be.

### Prototyping and Testing:
I used UserTesting.com to get feedback for my prototypes and designs. I tested the designs twice. Once for the lo-fi prototype, and once for the fi-fi prototype. I used the feedback gathered to make changes to the design. One example was on the product page, one tester said that they would like to “see some reviews from other people who bought the product”. So the reviews were added to the product page.

This project was originally done in Adobe XD. I transfered it to Figma to be able to share it. I lost some usability from the transfer, but the general idea is still there.
